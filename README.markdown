# Infinite Loop TD #
## A Never Ending Tower Defense Game #

**Infinite Loop TD** is a tower defense type of game with a twist: instead of ending when the playerâ€™s life reach zero, the game will end when a certain number of creeps (or mon- sters, enemies, etc.) are in play. A creep is considered _in play_ when it has entered the battle grounds and is still alive.

Like all tower defense games, there will be creeps running in a path for players to shoot, and players will be given the ability to con- struct towers to enable them to kill the creeps. In Infinite Loop TD, however, the path is just circular where creeps can roam around forever, until they are killed by the player.
